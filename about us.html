<br><br><font size="6">
The closest living relative to humans are chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas.<br><br> We share between 98 and 99.6% of DNA with these species. <br><br>Gorillas can even catch colds from humans.<br><br>

Most mammals have reproductive cycles. <br><br>However, only humans, humpback whales, and elephants experience menopause.<br><br>

To escape a crocodiles jaw, push your thumb into its eyeballs.<br><br>

Cats have only lived with people for about 7,000 years. Compared to dogs, whose domestication may have begun as early as 25,000 years ago.<br><br>

Most of the Earth’s longest-surviving species are found in the ocean.<br><br><br> While cyanobacterias are technically the oldest living organisms on Earth, having appeared 2.8 billion years ago, the ocean sponge has also been on Earth for 580 million years, and jellyfish have been here for 550 million years.<br><br>

85% of plant life is found in the ocean.<br><br>

The Amazon rainforest is an amazing place.<br><br> The Amazon produces over 20% of the world’s oxygen, and contains more than half of the world’s species of plants, animals, and insects.<br><br>

Additionally, up to 73 million sharks per year die due to shark finning, where fishermen catch the shark, cut off its fins, and throw the still-living shark back into the water.<br> <br>Many countries have imposed full or partial bans on finning, mainly that the sharks need to arrive onshore with fins attached. A few countries, notably Israel, Egypt, Ecuador, Honduras, Brunei and the Maldives, have total shark fishing bans.<br><br>

Many animals exhibit high levels of emotional intelligence.<br><br> For example, cows form bonds akin to friendships, and often have a “best friend,” and Gentoo Penguins bring a potential mate a pebble to “propose.”<br><br>
